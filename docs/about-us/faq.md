We understand that being a new member of a community can be quite daunting at times, which is why we’ve put together a list of frequently asked questions!

### Why should I trust myBot?

> We have many protocols in place to ensure the security of your data; we have intense security on our VPS, database, and everywhere else your data may be handled. Although we cannot disclose what our protocols are (due to security reasons), we can guarantee that your data is 100% safe with us!
>
> If you’re concerned about how good we are as a company, read some testimonials from our clients in the [#reviews](/discord) channel!

### Can I become a staff member?

> Keep an eye on our [#announcements](/discord) channel as that’s where we post applications when we’re in need of staff!

### What's the prefix for my bot and how do I change it?

> Your custom bot utilizes Discord's slash command system, therefore you cannot change the prefix.

### Why don’t my bot's commands appear?

> Please follow these steps, each time checking whether your issue was fixed or not:
1. Enable your bot's `Administrator` permission
2. Invite your bot with the link provided when you run the `/bots` command in our [server](/discord)
3. Refresh Discord (CTRL+R for desktop or force-close the app for mobile)
4. Re-invite your bot
5. Ensure the [Main Server ID](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID) (that is provided when running the `/bots` command in our [server](/discord)) is correct. If not, use the `/edit-bot main-server-id` command to change it
6. Enable the `USE_APPLICATION_COMMANDS` permission in the channel you’re trying to run the command in
7. Please reach out for support in our [Discord server](/discord)

### How do I disable a command?

> To enable/disable a specific command for a specific channel or user, navigate to the ‘Integrations’ tab of your server settings and click on your bot. From here, you can choose which commands specific users/roles can run, and in which channels.
>
> Note that the integrations tab doesn't yet work on mobile.

### Why do I keep getting the ‘Integration requires code grant’ error when I try inviting my bot?

> Please ensure this setting is disabled under the ‘Bot’ tab of your bot via https://discord.dev/:
>
> ![Requires oAuth2 Code Grant](/img/faq/code-grant.png)

### How do I create a bot?

> Follow [this tutorial](/docs/custom-bots/create-a-bot) to create a fully custom bot in under 2 minutes!

### Why does it cost so much just to buy a bot?

> If you buy our lifetime plan which costs a one-time payment of £22.50, it’s actually extremely cheap considering the fact that you get a fully customizable bot (which receives automatic updates every week) with many features.
>
> The payments we receive don’t even cover our monthly expenses, meaning that we don’t earn any profit. In fact, we’re taking money from our own pocket to pay our hosting provider every month to ensure myBot stays cheap forever.
