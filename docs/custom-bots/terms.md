# Terms & Conditions

---

By buying a bot from us, you agree to the following terms:

1. You may not claim that you created or are hosting/maintaining the bot.
2. We will not provide refunds under any circumstances.
3. If you are reported to be maliciously misusing or spamming the bot’s features, we reserve the right to take down your bot without notice or refund.
4. We hold no accountability if your whitelisted users decide to use commands for reasons you don’t approve of; there’s a `/settings` command and an 'Integrations' tab for a reason.
5. Your bot must not impersonate (or give the impression that your bot is associated with) Discord staff.
6. You may not plug-in external code to your bot in any way, shape or form.
