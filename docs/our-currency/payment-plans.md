# Payment Plans

---

There are three plans to choose from when purchasing a bot:

## Lifetime

A one-time payment of 75 [credits](/docs/our-currency/credit-pricing); perfect for anyone who doesn’t want to worry about payments down the line!

## Monthly

A monthly payment of 10 [credits](/docs/our-currency/credit-pricing); perfect for people who would rather pay in monthly instalments! Here’s some useful information regarding monthly plans:

- 72 hours before payment for the next month is due, if you don’t have enough credits you’ll receive a DM from our bot advising you to buy more credits.
- Once payment for the next month is due and you have enough credits, they’ll automatically be removed from your account and you’ll receive a DM from our bot.
- Once payment for the next month is overdue and you still don’t have enough credits, your bot will go offline until you run `/start-bot` with the correct number of credits in your account.
- Stopping your bot won’t delay your next payment.

## Free 7-Day Trial

A 7-day free trial; perfect for those who'd like to explore myBot's features before deciding whether to purchase a custom bot or not.

You're eligible for a free trial if you meet **all** of these requirements:

- You've never had a free trial before
- Your server has never had a free trial before
- The bot has never had a free trial before
- You don't already own a custom bot with us
- Your Discord account is over 2 weeks old

:::caution

It may be worth noting that as this is a **custom** bot, so you can only add it to 1 server.
